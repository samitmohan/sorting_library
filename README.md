# Objective : Sorting Library in C.

Goals -> To make a sorting library (sort.h) which you can include in your C program just like other library functions (stdio.h, string.h etc) and use all kinds of sorting without the need to implement them individually.

## Why? Because all other programming languages already have this function built in, it's time C does too.
Python -> sort() function, C++ STL -> sort(arr.begin(), arr.end()), Java Framework Libray -> sort() function.

Where as C (being a very fundamental and old langauge) does not have an inbuilt sorting library.

# What is an algorithm
-> Set of instructions in a procedural/sequential way to build/solve a problem

# What is a sorting algorithm?
Sorting algorithm is used to re-arrange a given array/vector/list of elements according to a comparision operator(ascending or descending)

# Types of sort in sort.h
-> Bubble Sort
-> Insertion Sort
-> Selection Sort
-> Merge Sort
-> Quick Sort
-> Cyclic Sort
-> Heap Sort

# Complexity
-> Time Complexity
-> Space Complexity

# Stability
-> Is the algorithm stable or not? 

# File Handling 
-> Read file num.txt containing of numbers of size n (given by user)
-> Pass file to sort function
-> Return file with sorted numbers

# Github
-> Upload all files to github, (deployment)
-> Learning git requests and how to collaborate with people.

# Implementation
#### To run -> Make sure all files are in the same folder, run via preferred editor/IDE
## Case 1 : Take input array from the user.

## Case 2 : Array already given by the user.

## Case 3 : File Handling -> num.txt file given with n numbers, sort the file.
